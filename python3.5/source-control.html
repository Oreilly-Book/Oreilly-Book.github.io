                <p>Source control, also known as <em>version control</em>, stores software code files
with a detailed history of every modification made to those files.</p><h2>Why is source control necessary?</h2><p>Version control systems allow developers to modify code without worrying
about permanently screwing something up. Unwanted changes can be easily rolled
back to previous working versions of the code. </p><p>Source control also makes team software development easier. One developer
can combine her code modifications with other developers' code through
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diff</a> views that show line-by-line
changes then merge the appropriate code into the main code branch.</p><p>Version control is a necessity on all software projects regardless of
development time, codebase size or the programming language used. Every
project should immediately begin by using a version control system such
as Git or Mercurial.</p><h2>Monorepo vs Multirepo</h2><p>There is a spectrum of philosophies for how to store projects within
source code repositories. </p><p>On one extreme end of the spectrum, every line of code for every project
within an organization is stored <strong>in a single repository</strong>. That approach
is called <em>monorepo</em> and it is used by companies like Google. On the other
end of the spectrum, there are potentially tens of thousands or more
repositories that store parts of projects. That approach is known as
<em>multirepo</em> or <em>manyrepo</em>. </p><p>For example, in a <a href="/python3.5/microservices.html">microservices</a> architecture, there
could be thousands of microservices and each one is stored within its own
repository. No one repository contains the code for the entire application
created by the interaction of the microservices.</p><p>There are many hybrid strategies for how to store source code that fall
between these opposite approaches. What to choose will depend on your
organization's needs, resources and culture.</p><h2>Source control during deployment</h2><p>Pulling code during a deployment is a potential way source control systems fit
into the deployment process. </p><p>Note that some developers recommend deployment pipelines package the source
code to deploy it and never have a production environment touch a source
control system directly. However, for small scale deployments it's often
easiest to pull from source code when you're getting started instead of
figuring out how to wrap the Python code in a system installation package.</p><h2>Source control projects</h2><p>Numerous source control systems have been created over the past several
decades. In the past, proprietary source control software offered features
tailored to large development teams and specific project workflows. However,
open source systems are now used for version control on the largest and most
complicated software projects in existence. There's no reason why your project
should use anything other than an open source version control system in
today's Python development world. The two primary choices are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/git.html">Git</a> is a free and open source distributed version
control system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/mercurial.html">Mercurial</a> is similar to Git, also a free
and open source distributed version control system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> is a centralized system where
developers must check files in and out of the hosted repository to minimize
merge conflicts.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Hosted version control services</h2><p>Git and Mercurial can be downloaded and run on your own server. However,
it's easy and cheap to get started with a hosted version control service.
You can transition away from the service at a later time by moving your
repositories if your needs change. A couple of recommended hosted version
control services are:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> has both a self-hosted version of its
open source software as well as their hosted version with
<a href="https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/">pricing</a> for businesses that need
additional hosting support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a software-as-a-service platform that
provides a user interface, tools and backup for developers to use with their
<a href="/python3.5/git.html">Git</a> repositories. Accounts are free for public open source
development and private Git repositories can also be hosted for
<a href="https://github.com/pricing">$7 per month</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/">BitBucket</a> is
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>'s software-as-a-service tool that
with a user interface, comparison tools and backup for Git projects. There
are many features in BitBucket focused on making it easier for groups of
developers to work on projects together. BitBucket also has private
repositories for up to five users. Users pay for hosting private
repositories with more than five users.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>General source control resources</h2><ul>

<p><a href="http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/">A visual guide to version control</a>
is a detailed article with real-life examples for why version control is
necessary in software development.</p>

explains the benefits and necessity of version control systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/07/07/cvs.html">Version control before Git with CVS</a>

</ul><h3>Monorepo vs multirepo resources</h3><p>Monorepo versus multirepo version control strategies are a weirdly
contentious topic in software development, likely because once a policy
is set for an organization it is exceptionally difficult to change
your approach. The following resources give more insight into the debate
on how to structure your repositories.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://notes.burke.libbey.me/metarepo/">Monorepo, Manyrepo, Metarepo</a>
is an awesome guide to varying ways of structuring your source repositories
that contain more than one project. The guide covers advantages and
disadvantages of common approaches used in both small and large
organizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/mono-vs-multi/">Repo Style Wars: Mono vs Multi</a>
goes into the implications of using one side or the other and why it is
unlikely you can create a combination solution that will give you the
advantages of both without the disadvantages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2016/7/204032-why-google-stores-billions-of-lines-of-code-in-a-single-repository/fulltext">Why Google Stores Billions of Lines of Code in a Single Repository</a>
covers the history and background of Google's source control monorepo,
which is one of if not the largest monorepo for an organization in the
world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://danluu.com/monorepo/">Advantages of monorepos</a> goes into the
advantages of using a monorepo and does not discuss the downsides but
admits there are many so the decision is not clear-cut on using either
strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://presumably.de/monorepos-and-the-fallacy-of-scale.html">Monorepos and the Fallacy of Scale</a>
argues that having all of an organization's code in a single repository
encourages code sharing. The author considers the concerns often raised
about tight coupling between components in a monorepo code base but says
that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages overall.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Git distributed source control system</h3><p><a href="/python3.5/git.html">Git</a> is the most widely-used source control system currently
in use. Its distributed design eliminates the need to check files in
and out of a centralized repository, which is a problem when using
<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> without a network connection. There is
<a href="/python3.5/git.html">a full page on Git</a> with further details and resources.</p><h3>Subversion resources</h3><p><a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Apache Subversion</a>
(<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/source-code.html">source code</a>),
often just called "Subversion" or "SVN", is a source control system
implementation.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/index.html">SVN book</a> is the
free online version of the O'Reilly
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SR2QIW/">Version Control with Subversion</a> book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://deveo.com/svn-tutorial/">How to use Subversion (SVN)</a> lays out
the basic concepts and provides the first few steps for getting started
tracking files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/04/svn-command-examples/">10 Most Used SVN Commands with Examples</a>
is a good refresher list if you've used SVN in the past but it has been
awhile since you worked with all the commands.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Source control learning checklist</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>Pick a version control system. Git is recommended because on the web there
are a significant number of tutorials to help both new and advanced users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn basic use cases for version control such as committing changes,
rolling back to earlier file versions and searching for when lines of code
were modified during development history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure your source code is backed up in a central repository. A central
repository is critical not only if your local development version is
corrupted but also for the deployment process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate source control into your deployment process in three ways. First,
pull the project source code from version control during deployments.
Second, kick off deployments when code is modified by using webhooks or
polling on the repository. Third, ensure you can roll back to a previous
version if a code deployment goes wrong.</p>
</li>
