                <p>Deployment involves packaging up your web application and putting it in a
production environment that can run the app.</p><h2>Why is deployment necessary?</h2><p>Your web application must live somewhere other than your own desktop or
laptop. A production environment is the canonical version of your current
application and its associated data.</p><h2>Deployment topics map</h2><p>Python web application deployments are comprised of many pieces that need to
be individually configured. Here is a map that visually depicts how each
deployment topic relates to each other. Click the image to pull up a PDF
version.</p><h2>Deployment hosting options</h2><p>There are four options for deploying and hosting a web application:</p><ol>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/servers.html">"Bare metal" servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/servers.html">Virtualized servers</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/servers.html">Infrastructure-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/platform-as-a-service.html">Platform-as-a-service</a></p>
</li>
</ol><p>The first three options are similar. The deployer needs to provision one or
more servers with a Linux distribution. System packages, a web server,
WSGI server, database and the Python environment are then installed. Finally
the application can be pulled from source and installed in the environment.</p><p>Note that there are other ways of installing a Python web application through
system-specific package management systems. We won't cover those in this
guide as they are considered advanced deployment techniques.</p><h2>Deployment tools</h2><ul>

continuous deployment and continuous delivery. Highly recommended for an

</ul><h2>Deployment learning checklist</h2><ol>
<li>
<p>If you're tight on time look at the
<a href="/python3.5/platform-as-a-service.html">platform-as-a-service (PaaS)</a> options. You
can deploy a low traffic project web app for free or low cost. You won't
have to worry about setting up the operating system and web server
compared to going the traditional server route. In theory you should be
able to get your application live on the web sooner with PaaS hosting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/python3.5/servers.html">Traditional server options</a> are your best bet for learning
how the entire Python web stack works. You'll often save money with a
virtual private server instead of a platform-as-a-service as you scale up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read about servers, <a href="/python3.5/operating-systems.html">operating systems</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/web-servers.html">web servers</a> and <a href="/python3.5/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a>
to get a broad picture of what components need to be set up to run a
Python web application.</p>
