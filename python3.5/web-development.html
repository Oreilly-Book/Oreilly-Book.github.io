                <p>Web development is the umbrella term for conceptualizing, creating,
<a href="/python3.5/deployment.html">deploying</a> and operating web applications and
<a href="/python3.5/application-programming-interfaces.html">application programming interfaces</a>
for the Web.</p><h2>Why is web development important?</h2><p>The Web has grown a mindboggling amount in the number of sites, users and
implementation capabilities since the
<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">first website</a> went live
in <a href="http://home.cern/topics/birth-web">1989</a>. Web development is the concept
that encompasses all the activities involved with websites and web
applications.</p><h2>How does Python fit into web development?</h2><p>Python can be used to build server-side web applications. While a
<a href="/python3.5/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> is not required to build web apps,
it's rare that developers would not use existing open source libraries to
speed up their progress in getting their application working.</p><p>Python is not used in a web browser. The language executed in browsers
such as Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer is
<a href="/python3.5/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>. Projects such as <a href="http://pyjs.org/">pyjs</a>
can compile from Python to JavaScript. However, most Python developers
write their web applications using a combination of Python and JavaScript.
Python is executed on the server side while JavaScript is downloaded to
the client and run by the web browser.</p><h3>Web development resources</h3><p>To become an experienced web developer you need to know the foundation
principles that the web is built with, such as HTTP requests and responses,
client (typically web browsers) and server (<a href="/python3.5/web-servers.html">web servers</a>
such as <a href="/python3.5/nginx.html">Nginx</a> and <a href="/python3.5/apache-http-server.html">Apache</a>
architectures, <a href="/python3.5/hypertext-markup-language-html.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a> and <a href="/python3.5/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>, among
many other topics. The following resources provide a range of perspectives
and when combined together should get you oriented in the web development
world.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/how-the-internet-works/">How the Internet works</a>
is a must-read to get a quick overview of all the pieces that go into
a network connection from one machine to another. The example explains how
an email is sent and the story is just as useful for learning about other
connections such as downloading a webpage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to be a web developer it's important to know the foundational
tools used to build websites and web applications. It is also important to
understand that the core concepts such as
HTTP, URLs and <a href="/python3.5/hypertext-markup-language-html.html">HTML</a> were all there
at the beginning and then were expanded with new specifications over time.
This article on the
<a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/">History of the Web</a>
succinctly explains the origins of the web starting from Tim Berners-Lee's
origin vision and release at CERN.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://engineering.videoblocks.com/web-architecture-101-a3224e126947">Web Architecture 101</a>
is a great high-level overview of the technologies that run the modern
web, such as DNS, load balancers, web application servers (for Python
that equates to <a href="/python3.5/wsgi-servers.html">WSGI servers</a>),
<a href="/python3.5/databases.html">data bases</a>, <a href="/python3.5/task-queues.html">task queues</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/caching.html">caching</a> and several other critical concepts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com/">Evolution of the Web</a> visualizes
how web browsers and related technologies have changed over time as well as
the overall growth of the Internet in the amount of data transferred. Note
that the visualization unfortunately stops around the beginning of 2013 but
it's a good way to explore what happened in the first 24 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when">What happens when?</a> is an
incredibly detailed answer to the questions "What happens when you
type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter?" that
seems straightforward on the surface until you really dig in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/">How browsers work</a>
provides an overview with solid detail on how browsers take the HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, images and other files as input and render webpages as
output. It is well worth your time to know this stuff as a web developer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-history-of-the-url/">The history of the URL</a>
explains how the growth of ARPANET to hundreds of nodes eventually led to
the creation of the URL. This is a great read that provides historical
context for why things are the way they are with the web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://dhilipsiva.com/webapp-checklist/">Web app checklist</a> presents
good practices that developers building and <a href="/python3.5/deployment.html">deploying</a>
web applications should follow. Don't worry about having every single
one of these recommendations implemented before getting your site
live, but it is worthwhile to review the list to make sure there is not
something obvious you can handle in a few minutes that will improve
your site's security, performance or usability.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/01/web-application-development-is-different-and-better.html">Web application development is different and better</a>
provides some context for how web development has evolved from writing
static HTML files into the complex JavaScript client-side applications
produced today.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vUs5yOuv-o">The Browser Hacker's Guide to Instantly Loading Everything</a>

that has great bits of developer knowledge for both beginner and
experienced web developers alike.</p>

<a href="https://defn.io/2018/03/20/web-app-from-scratch-03/">middleware</a> explores
the fundamentals of web development. Learning these foundational concepts
is critical for a web developer even though you should still plan to use an
established <a href="/python3.5/web-frameworks.html">web framework</a> such as
<a href="/python3.5/django.html">Django</a> or <a href="/python3.5/flask.html">Flask</a> to build real-world
applications. The
<a href="https://github.com/Bogdanp/web-app-from-scratch">open source code</a>

<p>While not Python-specific, Mozilla put together a
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn">Learning the Web</a> tutorial
for beginners and intermediate web users who want to build websites.
It's worth a look for general web development learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web development involves HTTP communication between the server, hosting
a website or web application, and the client, a web browser. Knowing
how web browsers works is important as a developer, so take a look at
this article on
<a href="https://medium.com/@camaelon/what-s-in-a-web-browser-83793b51df6c">what's in a web browser</a>.</p>

is a must-read for every web developer. Not everyone has fast Internet
service, whether because they are in a remote part of the world or they're
just in a subway tunnel. Optimizing sites so they work in those situations
is important for keeping your users happy.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://eager.io/blog/the-history-of-the-url-path-fragment-query-auth/">The History of the URL: Path, Fragment, Query, and Auth</a>

<li>
<p><a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/05/quantum-up-close-what-is-a-browser-engine/">Quantum Up Close: What is a browser engine?</a>
explains how a browser takes in
<a href="/python3.5/hypertext-markup-language-html.html">HTML</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/javascript.html">JavaScript</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/cascading-style-sheets.html">CSS</a>,

other data and files to produce a webpage as output.</p>

<p><a href="https://fly.io/articles/how-to-understand-performance-tests/">How to understand performance tests</a>
is an important topic because many websites are slow and bloated.
Learning about improving the performance of your site is one of
the best ways to become a better web developer. Another great article on
website performance is
<a href="https://speedcurve.com/blog/web-performance-page-bloat/">The average web page is 3MB. How much should we care?</a>.
The visuals alone tell a compelling story about how large webpage
sizes have grown in recent years.</p>
