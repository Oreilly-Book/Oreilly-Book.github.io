                <p>Learning to program is about understanding how to translate thoughts into
source code that can be executed on computers to achieve one or more goals.</p><p>There are many steps in learning how to program, including</p><ol>
<li>setting up a <a href="/python3.5/development-environments.html">development environment</a></li>
<li>selecting a <a href="/python3.5/python-programming-language.html">programming language</a>,
of which
<a href="/python3.5/why-use-python.html">Python is just one of many amazing ecosystems</a>
that you can decide to use</li>
<li>understanding the syntax and commands for the language</li>
<li>writing code in the language, often using
<a href="/python3.5/application-dependencies.html">pre-existing code libraries</a> and
<a href="/python3.5/web-frameworks.html">frameworks</a></li>
<li>executing the program</li>
<li><a href="/python3.5/debugging.html">debugging errors</a> and
<a href="/python3.5/testing.html">testing for unexpected results</a></li>
<li><a href="/python3.5/deployment.html">deploying</a> an application so it can run for intended
users</li>
</ol><h3>How should I learn programming?</h3><p>There are several schools of thought on how a person should start learning
to program. One school of thought is that a lower-level programming
language such as Assembly or C are the most appropriate languages to start
with because they force new developers to write their own data structures,
learn about pointers and generally work their way through the hard problems
in computer science.</p><p>There's certainly wisdom in this "low-level first" philosophy because it
forces a beginner to gain a strong foundation before moving on to higher
level topics such as web and mobile application development. This philosophy
is the one most commonly used in university computer science programs.</p><p>The atomic units of progress in the "low-level first" method of learning are </p><ol>
<li>aspects of programming language understood (type systems, syntax)</li>
<li>number of data structures coded and able to be used (stacks, queues)</li>
<li>algorithms in a developer's toolbelt (quicksort, binary search)</li>
</ol><p>Another school of thought is that new developers should bootstrap
themselves through working on projects in whatever programming language
interests them enough to keep working through the frustrations that will
undoubtably occur.</p><p>In this "project-based" line of thinking, the number of projects completed
that expand a programmer's abilities are the units of progress. Extra value
is placed on making the projects open source and working with experienced
mentors to learn what he or she can improve on in their programs. </p><p>Another way to learn that combines the project-based learning with defined
objectives is to play a computer game that will guide you through the
learning process. For example, <a href="https://www.twilio.com/quest/learn/python">TwilioQuest</a>
teaches the basics of Python in one of its missions and then has a
ton of free content for studying intermediate and advanced topics.</p><h3>Should I learn Python first?</h3><p>Python is good choice in the project-based approach because of the extensive
availability of
<a href="/python3.5/best-python-resources.html">free and low cost introductory resources</a>,
many of which provide example projects to build upon.</p><p>Note that this question of whether or not Python is a good first language
for an aspiring programmer is highly subjective and these approaches are
not mutually exclusive. Python is also widely taught in universities to
explain the fundamental concepts in computer science, which is in line
with the "low-level first" philosophy than the projects-first method.</p><p>In a nutshell, whether Python is the right first programming language to
learn is up to your own learning style and what feels right. If Ruby or Java
seem like they are easier to learn than Python, go for those languages.
Programming languages, and the ecosystems around them, are human-made
constructs. Find one that appears to match your personal style and give it a
try, knowing that whatever you choose you'll need to put in many long days and
nights to really get comfortable as a software developer.</p><h3>Practice problems</h3><p>Working on practice programming challenges and studying their solutions in
Python or another language is a great way to learn whether you are just
starting or an experienced developer. Here are numerous open source
repositories and sites with practice problems and solutions:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/norvig/pytudes">Pytudes</a> are an awesome collection
of Python programs to practice and demonstrate skills. These problems
go above and beyond the common data structures and algorithm questions
often found in other practice problem sets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges">Interactive Python coding interview challenges</a>

to know all of these algorithms and data structures but experience with
many of them will be greatly beneficial in becoming a better developer.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>First-hand advice</h3><p>These articles are written by programmers who explain how they learned to
code. They should not be taken as "this is how you must learn" but instead
give example paths you can think about taking as a beginner:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://danluu.com/learning-to-program/">Learning to program</a>
is a long read but goes through Dan's experience in math and engineering
before fully committing to software development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blog.ragnarson.com/2016/10/07/developing-as-a-developer.html">Developing as a developer</a>
gives general advice on qualities necessary to become a programmer,
including persistence, respecting others and considering ideas that are
outside your comfort zone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/kent-beck/mastering-programming/1184427814923414">Mastering programming</a>
by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> contains
patterns and observations for how experienced programmers he has worked
with in the past became great software developers.</p>

covers a well done graphics of many up-to-date concepts and tools that
developers use. The post reminds you that you will not and should not learn
everything but that you should pick tools you want to gain experience in
while generally knowing what else is out there.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Teaching perspectives</h3><p>Are you an experienced programmer working with new and junior programmers?
These articles give some insight into how you may want to structure
your teaching experience:</p><ul>
