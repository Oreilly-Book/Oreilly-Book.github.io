                <p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a distributed open source
<a href="/python3.5/source-control.html">source control</a> (also referred to as "version
control") system commonly used to track and manage file changes. Git is
frequently used as the version control system for Python projects.</p><h2>Why is Git widely-used by developers?</h2><p>Git is a <em>distributed</em> version control system (DVCS) compared to the
centralized models previously provided by
<a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a> and <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/cvs/">CVS</a>.
Files would need to be "checked out" over the network by a single person at
a time while she was working. The network transfer speed as well as the
blocking check out model became a significant bottleneck, especially for
large development teams. </p><p>Git clones a full repository and its entire history instead of just the
current state of a file. Developers only require a network connection when
pulling updates and pushing changes to a backup repository. The commit log
and file histories are stored and transmitted far more efficiently than
prior version control systems to maximize the effectiveness of the
distributed version control design.</p><p>Another issue with traditional VCS was that it was difficult to create
branches. Take a look
<a href="http://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/docs/cvs-tips.html">at this tutorial on managing a CVS repository</a>
as an example of the confusion the existing non-distributed models could
cause. Git simplified the branching process with simplified commands
such as <code>git checkout -b</code> and faster branch merging and clean up. In contrast
to earlier version control systems, Git encourages developers to create local
branches and experiment in them without impacting a stable <code>master</code> branch.</p><p><a href="https://www.github.com/">GitHub</a> also helped to drive Git as the overwhelming
version control favorite by providing the open source community with free open
remote Git repositories. GitHub's web application user interface, issue
tracking and pull request features for maintainers and consumers also
encouraged more collaboration than Git alone. Recently,
<a href="https://github.com/marketplace">GitHub's third-party marketplace</a> has
begun to add more features by integrating
<a href="/python3.5/continuous-integration.html">continuous integration</a> servers like
as <a href="/python3.5/jenkins.html">Jenkins</a> and <a href="/python3.5/code-metrics.html">code metrics</a> services.</p><h2>Beginner Git tutorials</h2><p>Git can take awhile to wrap your head around, even for experienced software

you need tactical support or want to learn new tricks to add to your
workflow. These resources will come in handy for specific Git subjects.</p><ul>
<li>

</ul><h2>Git Workflows</h2><p>Teams of developers can use Git in varying workflows because of Git's
distributed model and lightweight branching. There is no "right way" to
use Git, especially because development teams can range in size from a
single developer up to entire companies with thousands of developers in
a repository. The only correct answer is to let the developers decide on
a workflow that maximizes their ability to frequently commit code and
minimize merge conflicts.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">git-flow</a> shows
one possible way for small teams to use Git branches.
<a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">GitHub Flow</a> explains
why at GitHub they do not use the git-flow model and provides an
alternative that solves some of the issues they found with git-flow.</p>
