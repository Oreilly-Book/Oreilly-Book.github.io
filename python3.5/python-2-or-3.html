                <p>The Python programming language is almost finished with a long-term transition
from version 2 to version 3. New programmers often have questions about which
version they should learn. It can be confusing to hear that Python 3, which was
originally released in 2008, is still not the default installation on some
operating systems such as macOS. However, that situation is rapidly changing
as the final version 2 release, Python 2.7, is approaching its end-of-life
that is definitively scheduled for
<a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2018-March/152348.html">January 1, 2020</a>.</p><p>The simple answer right now is: <em>learn Python 3</em>, specifically the latest
version which as of October 2019 is
<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3.7</a>. If for some reason you
absolutely have to learn Python 2, for example because your employer is
working on a bunch of legacy code, you will be able to transfer the majority
of your knowledge from Python 2 right into Python 3. Likewise, you will
still be able to read and write Python 2 code if you start with Python 3.</p><p>There are enough <a href="/python3.5/best-python-resources.html">great resources</a>
out there that will teach you to code in version 3 without any prior
version 2 experience. Python 3 is the future and you will not regret
starting with the latest version of the
<a href="/python3.5/learning-programming.html">programming language</a>.</p><p>There is one small caveat to the recommendation to go full-on Python 3.
You may infrequently come across lesser-used open source code libraries
that were originally written in Python 2 that do not completely support
Python 3. That was the case before 2019 with <a href="/python3.5/devops.html">DevOps</a>
<a href="/python3.5/configuration-management.html">configuration management tools</a> such as
<a href="http://www.fabfile.org/">Fabric</a> or <a href="/python3.5/ansible.html">Ansible</a>. However,
those libraries now support Python 3 and the usage problems that were
frequent in years past are now typically not a concern. Knowing how
to upgrade Python 2 libraries to 3.x is still a useful skill to apply
at the edges of the Python open source community.</p><h2>Visualizations and Projects</h2><p>Since upgrading from Python 2 to 3 has been such a huge undertaking within
the community, many projects have sprung up to make the transition easier.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/six/">six</a> is a 2/3 compatibility library that
is a dependency for many popular Python projects to make it easier to
support both Python 2 and 3 at the same time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://py3readiness.org/">Python 3 Readiness</a> is a visualization of
which most popular 360 libraries (by downloads) are ready to be
used with Python 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">Python clock</a> counts down the time until
Python 2.x is no longer maintained. While Python 2's retirement
may still seem a long time away, it can take a lot of time and effort to
migrate existing application to the modified syntax in 3.x.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Porting to Python 3 resources</h3><p>Moving an existing codebase to Python 3 from 2 can be a daunting task,
These resources were created by fellow developers who've previously
gone through the process and have advice for making it less painful.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://python3porting.com/">Python 3 Porting</a> is an entire book with
details for how to upgrade your existing projects and libraries to
Python 3.x.</p>

to Python 3. Their process involved upgrading dependencies, testing and
deploying the new version before going back to clean up unnecessary code
created by the transition.</p>
