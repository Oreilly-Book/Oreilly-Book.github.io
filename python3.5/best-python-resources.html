                <p>The Python community is amazing at sharing detailed resources and helping
beginners learn to program with the language. There are so many resources
out there though that it can be difficult to know how to find them. </p><p>This page aggregates the best general Python resources with descriptions of
what they provide to readers.</p><h2>New to programming</h2><p>If you're learning your first programming language these books were written
with you in mind. Developers learning Python as a second or later language
should skip down to the next section for "experienced developers".</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.twilio.com/quest/learn/python">TwilioQuest</a> is an free and
incredible 16-bit adventure game that teaches programming in the Python
basics mission. It's an absolutely way to stay engaged with the core
concepts that can often be otherwise dry to learn. There are also more
advanced missions to learn about
<a href="/python3.5/application-programming-interfaces.html">web APIs</a>, and new
learning missions are added regularly on new programming topics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a>
is an incredible book for both non-developers and professional developers
alike. Each chapter walks through a situation that can be automated using
Python such as manipulating images, organizing your files and
programmatically controlling your mouse and keyboard to handle any sort
of tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall/">CS for All</a> is an open book by professors
at Harvey Mudd College which teaches the fundamentals of computer science
using Python. It's an accessible read and perfect for programming beginners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvK0UzFNw1Q">short 5 minute video</a>
explains why it's better to think of projects you'd like to build and
problems you want to solve with programming. Start working on those projects
and problems rather than jumping into a specific language that's recommended
to you by a friend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.grahamwheeler.com/posts/python-crash-course.html">A Python Crash Course</a>
gives an awesome overview of the history of Python, what drives the
programming community and dives into example code. You will likely need
to read this in combination with other resources to really let the syntax
sink in, but it's a great article to read several times over as you
continue to learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/tag/python">Python projects tag</a> on the
Twilio blog is constantly updated with fun tutorials you can build to
learn Python, such as the
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/11/international-space-station-notifications-with-python-redis-queue-and-twilio-copilot.html">International Space Station Tracker with Flask and Redis-Queue</a>,
<a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html">Choose Your Own Adventures Presentations using Flask and WebSockets</a>
and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/blog/2015/11/getting-started-with-opencv-and-python-featuring-the-martian-2.html">Martianify Photos with OpenCV</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/python/">A Byte of Python</a> is a beginner's
tutorial for the Python language. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google put together a great compilation of materials and subjects you
should read and learn from if you want to be a
<a href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html">professional programmer</a>.
Those resources are useful not only for Python beginners but any developer
who wants to have a strong professional career in software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The O'Reilly book
<a href="http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html">Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pymbook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Python for you and me</a> is an
approachable book with sections for Python syntax and the major language
constructs. The book also contains a short guide at the end to get
programmers to write their first Flask web application.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Python for specific occupations</h2><p>Python is powerful for many professions. If you're seeking to use Python in a
specific field, one of these guides may be the most appropriate for you.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~gawron/python_for_ss/">Python for Social Scientists</a>
contains a textbook, course outline and slides for a college course that taught
social scientists to use Python for their profession.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pbpython.com/">Practical Business Python</a> is a blog that covers topics
such as how to automate generating large Excel spreadsheets or perform analysis
when your data is locked in Microsoft Office files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://fbkarsdorp.github.io/python-course/">Python for the Humanities</a> is a
textbook and course on the basics of Python and text processing. Note if you've
never worked with Python before the material ramps up quickly after the first
chapter so you will likely want to combine it with some other introduction to
Python resources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://python4astronomers.github.io/">Practical Python for Astronomers</a>
provides open source workshop materials for teaching students studying
astronomy to use Python for data analysis.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Experienced developers new to Python</h2><p>If you can already program in another language, these resources are better for
getting up to speed because they are more concise when explaining introductory
topics.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/">Learn Python in y minutes</a>
provides a whirlwind tour of the Python language. The guide is especially
useful if you're coming in with previous software development experience
and want to quickly grasp how the language is structured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://testdriven.io/courses/real-time-app-with-django-channels-and-angular/?utm_source=fsp">Developing a Real-Time Taxi App with Django Channels and Angular</a>
is a great tutorial for jumping into a real project instead of a simple
starter application while learning common Python concepts and tools such
as <a href="/python3.5/django.html">Django</a>, <a href="/python3.5/angular.html">Angular</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/websockets.html">WebSockets</a> and <a href="/python3.5/redis.html">Redis</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers familiar with other languages often have difficulty adapting to
accepted Python code style. Make sure to read the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP8</a> code style guidelines
as well as
<a href="https://github.com/amontalenti/elements-of-python-style">The Elements of Python Style</a>
to know the Python community standards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://testdriven.io/courses/auth-flask-react/?utm_source=fsp">Authentication with Flask, React, and Docker</a>
is another detailed course that shows how to combine
<a href="/python3.5/flask.html">Flask</a>, <a href="/python3.5/react.html">React</a>, <a href="/python3.5/docker.html">Docker</a>
and <a href="/python3.5/heroku.html">Heroku</a> to build a solid intermediate-to-advanced
web application and deploy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://notesbyanerd.com/2017/12/29/essential-reads-for-any-python-programmer/">Essential Reads for Any Python Programmer</a>

programming language ecosystem such as Java.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://districtdatalabs.silvrback.com/how-to-develop-quality-python-code">How to Develop Quality Python Code</a>
is a good read to begin learning about development environments,
application dependencies and project structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://pymotw.com/2/contents.html">Python module of the week</a>
chapters are a good way to get up to speed with the standard library.
Doug Hellmann is also now updating the list for changes brought about
from the upgrade to Python 3 from 2.x.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a> shows how to build
compilers with Python 3, which is a good undertaking if you're looking
to learn both more about the Python language and how compiles work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev">free-for-dev</a> is not specific
to Python but it's a fantastic list of free tier resources for experienced
developers. The list is especially handy if you want to try building a
Python project and need new third party services to kick around while
experimenting.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Videos, screencasts and presentations</h2><p>Videos from conferences and meetups along with screencasts are listed on
the <a href="/python3.5/best-python-videos.html">best Python videos</a> page.</p><h2>Curated Python packages lists</h2><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python">awesome-python</a> is an incredible
list of Python frameworks, libraries and software. I wish I had this
page when I was just getting started. </p>
</li>
<li>

awesome-python although instead of just a Git repository this site is
in the Read the Docs format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cjbarber/ToolsOfTheTrade">Hacker News Tools of the Trade</a>
is not specific to Python but almost all of the tools and services are
useful to building software projects.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Podcasts</h2><p>Take a look at the <a href="/python3.5/best-python-podcasts.html">best Python podcasts</a>
section for a curated list of both Python-specific and general software
development podcasts.</p><h2>Newsletters</h2><p>Python's active community constantly publishes new tutorials and
walkthroughs. It is easier to keep up if you follow along by subscribing
to several email newsletters that round up and curate the best new
resources. I subscribe to all of the following newsletters and find that
each one has its own unique take on what resources are most important
to send out to the community.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.pythonweekly.com/">Python Weekly</a> is a free weekly roundup
of the latest Python articles, videos, projects and upcoming events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://pycoders.com/">PyCoder's Weekly</a> is another great free weekly
email newsletter similar to Python Weekly. The best resources are generally
covered in both newsletters but they often cover different articles
and projects from around the web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://talkpython.fm/friends-of-the-show">Talk Python's Friends of the Show</a>
