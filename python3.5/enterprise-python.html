                <p>One of the misconceptions around Python and other dynamically-typed languages
is that they cannot be reliably used to build enterprise-grade software.
However, almost all commercial and government enterprises already use
Python in some capacity, either as glue code between disparate applications
or to build the applications themselves. </p><h2>What is enterprise software?</h2><p>Enterprise software is built for the requirements of an organization rather
than the needs of an individual. Software written for enterprises often
needs to integrate with legacy systems, such as existing databases and
non-web applications. There are often requirements to integrate with
authentication systems such as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</a>
and
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746492%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Active Directory (AD)</a>.</p><p>Organizations develop enterprise software with numerous custom requirements
to fit the specific needs of their operating model. Therefore the software
development process often becomes far more complicated due to disparate
factions within an organization vying for the software to handle their
needs at the expense of other factions.</p><p>The complexity due to the many stakeholders involved in the building of
enterprise software leads to large budgets and extreme scrutiny by
non-technical members of an organization. Typically those non-technical
people place irrational emphasis on the choice of programming language and
frameworks when otherwise they should not make technical design decisions.</p><h2>Why are there misconceptions about Python in enterprise environments?</h2><p>Traditionally large organizations building enterprise software have used
statically typed languages such as C++, .NET and Java. Throughout the 1980s
and 1990s large companies such as Microsoft, Sun Microsystems and Oracle
marketed these languages as "enterprise grade". The inherent snub to other
languages was that they were not appropriate for CIOs' difficult technical
environments. Languages other than Java, C++ and .NET were seen as risky and
therefore not worthy of investment.</p><p>In addition, "scripting languages" such as Python, Perl and Ruby were not
yet robust enough in the 1990s because their core standard libraries were
still being developed. Frameworks such as <a href="/python3.5/django.html">Django</a>,
<a href="/python3.5/flask.html">Flask</a> and Rails (for Ruby) did not yet exist. The Web was
just beginning and most enterprise applications were desktop apps built
for Windows. Python simply wasn't made for such environments.</p><h2>Why is Python now appropriate for building enterprise software?</h2><p>From the early 2000s through today the languages and ecosystems for many
dynamically typed languages have greatly improved and often surpassed some
aspects of other ecosystems. Python, Ruby and other previously derided
languages now have vast, well-maintained open source ecosystems backed by
both independent developers and large companies including Microsoft, IBM,
Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Twilio and many, many others.</p><p>Python's open source libraries, especially for
<a href="/python3.5/web-frameworks.html">web development</a> and data analysis, are some of the
best maintained and fully featured pieces of code for any language.</p><p>Meanwhile, some of the traditional enterprise software development languages
such as Java have languished due to underinvestment by their major corporate
backers. When <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/018363">Oracle purchased Sun Microsystems in 2009</a>
there was a long lag time before Java was enhanced with new language features
in Java 7. Oracle also
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/03/06/java-adware-mac/">bundles unwanted adware with the Java installation</a>,
whereas the Python community would never put up with such a situation because
the language is open source and does not have a single corporate controller.</p><p>Other ecosystems, such as the .NET platform by Microsoft have fared much
better. Microsoft continued to invest in moving the .NET platform along
throughout the early part of the new millennium.</p><p>However, Microsoft's enterprise products often have expensive licensing fees
for their application servers and associated software. In addition, Microsoft
is also a major backer of open source, <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/OneOfMicrosoftsBestKeptSecretsPythonToolsForVisualStudioPTVS.aspx">especially Python</a>,
and their
<a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/features/python/">Python tools for Visual Studio</a>
provide a top-notch <a href="/python3.5/development-environments.html">development environment</a>.</p><p>The end result is that enterprise software development has changed
dramatically over the past couple of decades. CIOs and technical executives
can no longer ignore the progress of Python and the great open source
community in the enterprise software development landscape if they want to
continue delivering business value to their business side customers.</p><h3>Open source enterprise Python projects</h3><p>Python is widely used across large enterprise organizations but the code
is often not put out as open source. If you come across projects that are
appropriate for this list, <a href="/python3.5/about-author.html">contact me</a> to let me know:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/cfpb/collab">Collab</a> by the
U.S. government's
<a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a>
(CFPB) agency is a corporate intranet and collaboration platform for large
organizations. The project is currently running and in-use by thousands of
CFPB employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/twitter/pants">Pants</a> is a build system for software
projects with many distinct parts and built with many different programming
languages as is often the case in large organizations.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Enterprise Python software development resources</h3><p>The following articles cover topics in enterprise development that are
often not discussed when dealing with standard Python development.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Talk Python to Me's fourth episode interviewed PayPal's lead developer on
<a href="http://www.talkpythontome.com/episodes/show/4/enterprise-python-and-large-scale-projects">Enterprise Python and Large-Scale Projects</a>.
They rebuke many of the myths around Python for large scale projects
including the variable typing system and scalability.</p>

covers one developer's experience researching,

enterprise application in Python and <a href="/python3.5/django.html">Django</a>.</p>

<li>
<p>Mozilla's <a href="https://infosec.mozilla.org/">Enterprise InfoSec</a> resources

to understand all the jargon that goes along with the enterprise
security domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.leanessays.com/2017/01/the-end-of-enterprise-it.html">The end of enterprise IT</a>
is a fascinating essay that actually does not talk about Python in
particular but shows how large enterprise IT departments such as the
one at ING Bank have to evolve their structure, processes and tools to
successfully ship software. Programming languages such as Python are more
likely to be used in these updated polyglot and
<a href="/python3.5/devops.html">DevOps</a>-driven environments.</p>

<p>There are a couple of solid demystifying articles in CIO magazine including
<a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2437137/developer/you-used-python-to-write-what-.html">this broad overview of Python in enterprises</a>
and this article on

<p>I gave a talk at DjangoCon 2014 on

<li>
<p>This <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/141411/what-is-enterprise-software-exactly">StackExchange answer</a>

from traditional software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There was a
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3myppd/everyone_who_encounters_it_seems_to_love_python/">Python subreddit thread about Python in the enterprise</a>
that's worth a look for broader opinions on Python compared to Java and
.NET in enterprise environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://zwischenzugs.com/2018/10/02/why-are-enterprises-so-slow/">Why are enterprises so slow?</a>

cultural and financial reasons why large companies often move so slowly.</p>
