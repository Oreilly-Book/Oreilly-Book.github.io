                <p>Application dependencies are the libraries other than your project code
that are required to create and run your application. </p><h2>Why are application dependencies important?</h2><p>Python web applications are built upon the work done by thousands of open
source programmers. Application dependencies include not only web frameworks but
also libraries for scraping, parsing, processing, analyzing, visualizing,
and many other tasks. Python's ecosystem facilitates discovery, retrieval and
installation so applications are easier for developers to create.</p><h2>Finding libraries</h2><p>Python libraries are stored in a central location known as the
<a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a>. PyPi contains
search functionality with results weighted by usage and relevance based on
keyword terms.</p><p>Besides PyPi there are numerous resources that list common or "must-have"
libraries. Ultimately the decision for which application dependencies are
necessary for your project is up to you and the functionality you're looking
to build. However, it's useful to browse through these lists in case you come
across a library to solve a problem by reusing the code instead of writing it
all yourself. A few of the best collections of Python libraries are</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules">Python.org's useful modules</a>
which groups modules into categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/trending?l=python">GitHub Explore Trending repositories</a>
shows the open source Python projects trending today, this week, and this
month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This list of <a href="http://freepythontips.wordpress.com/2013/07/30/20-python-libraries-you-cant-live-without/">20 Python libraries you can’t live without</a>
is a wide-ranging collection from data analysis to testing tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wikipedia actually has an extensive
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Python_software">page dedicated to Python libraries</a>
grouped by categories.</p>
</li>
</ul><h2>Isolating dependencies</h2><p>Dependencies are installed separately from system-level packages to prevent
library version conflicts. The most common isolation method is
<a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtualenv</a>. Each virtualenv is its
own copy of the Python interpreter and dependencies in the site-packages
directory. To use a virtualenv it must first be created with the virtualenv
command and then activated.</p><p>The virtualenv stores dependencies in an isolated environment. The web
application then relies only on that virtualenv instance which has a separate
copy of the Python interpreter and site-packages directory. A high level of
how a server configured with virtualenv can look is shown in the picture below.</p><h2>Installing Python dependencies</h2><p>The recommended way to install Python library dependencies is with the
<a href="http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/">pip</a> command when a virtualenv
is activated.</p><p>Pip and virtualenv work together and have complementary responsibilities.
Pip downloads and installs application dependencies from the central
<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPi</a> repository. </p><h2>requirements.txt</h2><p>The pip convention for specifying application dependencies is with a
<code>requirements.txt</code> file. When you build a Python web application you
should include <code>requirements.txt</code> in the base directory of your project.</p><p>Python projects' dependencies for a web application should be specified
with pegged dependencies like the following:</p><p>Pegged dependencies with precise version numbers or Git tags are important
because otherwise the latest version of a dependency will be used. While
it may sound good to stay up to date, there's no telling if your application
actually works with the latest versions of all dependencies. Developers should
deliberately upgrade and test to make sure there were no backwards-incompatible
modifications in newer dependency library versions.</p><h2>setup.py</h2><p>There is another type of dependency specification for Python libraries
known as
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1471994/what-is-setup-py">setup.py</a>.
Setup.py is a standard for distributing and installing Python libraries.
If you're building a Python library, such as
<a href="https://github.com/twilio/twilio-python">twilio</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/underwear">underwear</a> you must include setup.py
so a dependency manager can correctly install both the library as well as
additional dependencies for the library. There's still quite a bit of
confusion in the Python community over the difference between
requirements.txt and setup.py, so read this
<a href="https://caremad.io/2013/07/setup-vs-requirement/">well written post</a> for
further clarification.</p><h3>Open source app dependency projects</h3><p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">pip and venv</a> are part of
Python 3's standard library as of version 3.3. However, there are numerous
other open source libraries that can be helpful when managing application
dependencies in your projects, as listed below.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv">Autoenv</a> is a tool for activating
environment variables stored in a <code>.env</code> file in your projects' home
directories. Environment variables aren't managed by virtualenv and although
virtualenvwrapper has some hooks for handling them, it's often easiest to
use a shell script or <code>.env</code> file to set them in a development environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pipenv</a> is a newer Python
packaging and dependency management library that has seen some adoption
in place of the standard <code>pip</code> library.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs">Pipreqs</a> searches through a project for
dependencies based on imports. It then generates a <code>requirements.txt</code> file
based on the libraries necessary to run those dependencies. Note though that
while this could come in handy with a legacy project, the version numbers
for those libraries will not be generated with the output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bartTC/pip-check">pip-check</a> presents a nicely-formatted
list of all your installed dependencies and the status of whether or not
updates are available for each of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/prakashdanish/pip-name">pip-name</a> is a straightforward
library that looks up package names on PyPI and tells you whether or not
the library name is already taken.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>Code library packaging guides</h3><p>There are many steps in creating and distributing packages on PyPI and
your own hosted application dependency servers. Many of these steps involve
writing configuration files that are not as well documented as some other
areas of Python development. These resources are the best ones I have found
so far to get up to speed on building and releasing your own packages.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://packaging.python.org/">Python Packaging User Guide</a>

distribute Python code libraries.</p>

</ul><h3>Application dependencies learning checklist</h3><ol>
<li>
<p>Ensure the libraries your web application depends on are all captured in
a <code>requirement.txt</code> file with pegged versions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An easy way to capture currently installed dependencies is with the
<code>pip freeze</code> command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a fresh virtualenv and install the dependencies from your
<code>requirements.txt</code> file by using the <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check that your application runs properly with the fresh virtualenv and
only the installed dependencies from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p>
