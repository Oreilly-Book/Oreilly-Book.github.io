                <p><a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (<a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">source code</a>),
short for Vi IMproved, is a configurable text editor often used as
a Python development environment. Vim proponents commonly cite the numerous
plugins, Vimscript and logical command language as major Vim strengths.</p><h2>Why is Vim a good Python development environment?</h2><p>Vim's philosophy is that developers are more productive when they avoid
taking their hands off the keyboard. Code should flow naturally from the
developer's thoughts through the keyboard and onto the screen. Using a mouse
or other peripheral is a detriment to the rate at which a developer's
thoughts become code. This "efficiency by keyboard"
<a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/how-did-vim-become-so-popular/">keeps Vim as one of the most popular text editors</a>
despite having been around for decades. Few programming tools have that kind
of staying power.</p><p>Vim has a logical, structured command language. When a beginner is learning
the editor she may feel like it is impossible to understand all the key
commands. However, the commands stack together in a logical way so that over
time the editor becomes predictable.</p><h2>Configuring Vim with a Vimrc file</h2><p>The Vimrc file is used to configure the Vim editor. A Vimrc file can range
from nothing in it to very complicated with hundreds or thousands of lines
of configuration commands.</p><p>Here's a short, commented example .vimrc file I use for Python development
to get a feel for some of the configuration statements:</p><p>Here is how these configuration options look with a dark background on
Mac OS X while editing the markdown for this webpage (how meta!).</p><p>Take a look at another example using these configuration options, this time
with a light background and editing Python code from my
<a href="https://github.com/mattmakai/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations">Choose Your Own Adventures Presentations</a>
project.</p><p>The Vimrc file lives under the home directory of the user account running
Vim. For example, when my user account is 'matt', on Mac OS X my Vimrc
file is found at <code>/Users/matt/.vimrc</code>. On Ubuntu Linux my .vimrc file
can be found within the <code>/home/matt/</code> directory.</p><p>If a Vimrc file does not already exist, just create it within the user's
home directory and it will be picked up by Vim the next time you open the
editor.</p><p>The following are a few resources for learning what to put in, and how to
structure a <code>.vimrc</code> file. I recommend adding configuration options one
at a time to test them individually instead of going whole hog with a Vimrc
you are unfamiliar with.</p><ul>

to get started with these tutorials.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">Learn Vim Progressively</a>

learn just enough to survive with it as your day-to-day editor then begin
adding more advanced commands on top.</p>

<p><a href="https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/">A vim Tutorial and Primer</a> is an

<li>
<p><a href="https://medium.com/@mkozlows/why-atom-cant-replace-vim-433852f4b4d1">Why Atom Can't Replace Vim</a>
discusses one of Vim's core principles: command composability. Vim has
a language where simple commands are combined to execute more advanced
operations. For example, in command mode,<code>$</code> moves to the end of a line.
When <code>$</code> is preceded by <code>d</code> then everything to the end of the line is
deleted. Over time the simple commands become intuitive and the
combinations become more powerful than having distinct commands such as
a drop-down menu with a specific option to delete all text until the end
of the line.</p>

into without realizing they were ever there. The following tutorials show
how to use some specific niche features. You may already know about these
if you have been using Vim for awhile but everyone's learning path is
different so it's useful to do a quick scan to make sure you are not missing
anything.</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/vim-number/">Vim’s absolute, relative and hybrid line numbers</a>
