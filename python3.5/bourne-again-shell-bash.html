                <p>The <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">Bourne-Again SHell</a>
(<a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash">source code</a>), almost
always referred to simply as "<em>Bash</em>", interprets and executes input
entered from a source such as the user or a program. Bash is an
implementation of the <a href="/python3.5/shells.html">shell concept</a> and is often used
during Python software development as part of a programmer's
<a href="/python3.5/development-environments.html">development environment</a>.</p><h3>How do Python developers use Bash?</h3><p>If you are programming in the terminal on <a href="/python3.5/macos.html">macOS</a>
or <a href="/python3.5/ubuntu.html">Linux</a>, or using the
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10">Windows Subsystem for Linux on Windows 10</a>,
you can easily gain access to Bash if it is not already
your default shell.</p><p>You can show what shell you are currently using by echoing the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable, like so:</p><p>Which will then print the shell you are currently using. For example,
on macOS I am using Bash by default so the echo command prints:</p><p>How much you use Bash or any shell will likely depend on your
<a href="/python3.5/development-environments.html">development environment</a>, especially
if you are using an editor like <a href="/python3.5/vim.html">Vim</a> instead of an
IDE like <a href="/python3.5/pycharm.html">PyCharm</a>, because it is often easier to do
certain tasks in the shell. For example, most developers I know who
use PyCharm will search for some instance of source code right in
their IDE, whereas I use a combination of Vim and <a href="/python3.5/tmux.html">tmux</a>
so I frequently flip between panes to use commands like <code>grep</code> to
do my source code searches. </p><p>There is no right way to perform a task like source code searching, it's
really just what works for your brain as a developer that will guide
how often you interact with the Bash shell.</p><h3>Getting started with Bash</h3><p>Working with a shell, Bash or otherwise, is intimidating the first time
you try to get started. You are staring at the <code>$</code> prompt without a
whole lot of direction.</p><p>When you are completely new to using Bash, it is a good idea to at least
scan, if not take some additional time for in-depth reading of the
documentation for commands that every developer uses. The following
commands are used so frequently in Bash that an experienced developer
probably does not even think about them anymore, they become just a
natural part of your workflow:</p><ul>
<li><code>echo</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/echo.1.html">print text to the command line</a></li>
<li><code>ls</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html">list the contents of a directory</a></li>
<li><code>cd</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html">change the working directory</a></li>
<li><code>cp</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html">copy a file or directory</a></li>
<li><code>mv</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/mv.1.html">move one or more files</a></li>
<li><code>rm</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/rm.1.html">delete one or more files or directories</a></li>
</ul><p>If you know how to use the above commands then you will at least be able
to move around the file system, create, move and update files and know
what is on your storage device(s).</p><p>The following commands are somewhat more advanced but also frequently
used by developers:</p><ul>
<li><code>su</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/su.1.html">run comamnds as different users or groups</a></li>
<li><code>whoami</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/whoami.1.html">print which user you are currently logged in as</a></li>
<li><code>grep</code>: <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/grep.1.html">searches for patterns in files</a></li>
</ul><p>The above lists are not even close to exhaustive for what commands
you need to know when working with Bash. Read some of the following
introductory tutorials to gain a better understanding of working
with this shell:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners">The Linux command line for beginner</a>

use the command line, working with files and directories, and handling
superuser commands.</p>

commands, paths, Bash shell scripting, variables and many other critical
topics that are necessary to move from beginner to advanced Bash user. </p>

</ul><h3>Bash scripting</h3><p>Bash is used not only as an interactive prompt but also for scripting, which
makes it possible to execute one or more Bash commands stored within a file.
These scripts can be short, with only a single command, or very complicated
with control-flow logic, for loops, and almost anything you want to automate
or compute because
<a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-Turing-complete">Bash is a Turing-complete programming language</a>.</p><p>Complex Bash scripts sometimes get a negative reputation because they can be
difficult to read and understand if you are not the original author (or you
are reading your own script after a significant period of time has elapsed).
There are many ways to accomplish the same tasks with Bash so the files are
often confusing to read unless the author of a script included clear
documentation. This readability problem is typically less of an issue with
Python scripts because spacing is enforced and the standard library
encapsulates common tasks.</p><p>It's a good idea to think about how you want to structure your Bash scripts
as they grow larger. The following resources provide insight into what you
should consider while coding Bash scripts.</p><ul>
<li>
<p>This <a href="https://betterdev.blog/minimal-safe-bash-script-template/">minimal safe Bash template</a>

understand and use it as a base then it will make your scripts
easier to maintain over time.</p>

script that was never meant to be used by anyone other than the original
author.</p>
